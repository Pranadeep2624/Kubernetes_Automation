## Kubernetes Application Deployment Automation

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the complete automation of deploying an application in a Kubernetes environment using modern DevOps tools and best practices. It integrates multiple technologies to streamline application deployment, infrastructure provisioning, and monitoring, ensuring a seamless and efficient development lifecycle.

## Tools Used
Version Control & CI/CD
GitHub
Jenkins
Cloud Services (AWS)
Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)
Elastic Container Registry (ECR)
## Infrastructure as Code
Terraform

## Deployment & Management
Argo CD
Helm Charts
Monitoring
Prometheus & Grafana

## Project Structure
#### Features & Automation Steps
1. Automate Cloud Infrastructure Setup
Utilizing Terraform, this project provisions essential AWS services:
EKS for orchestrating Kubernetes workloads.
ECR for storing Docker images.
S3 for managing Terraform state files securely.
### 2. Implement CI/CD Pipeline
A Jenkins pipeline is set up to automate the following processes:
Pulling application code from GitHub.
Building and pushing Docker images to ECR.
Deploying infrastructure with Terraform.
Managing Kubernetes deployment workflows.
## 3. Leverage Kubernetes & Helm
The application is deployed using Helm charts, which simplify Kubernetes resource management and configuration.
### 4. Adopt Argo CD
Argo CD is used for declarative and automated Kubernetes deployment, ensuring continuous delivery and synchronization of application state.
### 5. Integrate Monitoring Tools
Prometheus & Grafana (or AWS CloudWatch) provide real-time monitoring and logging of the application's health and performance.

#### Getting Started
# Prerequisites
AWS CLI configured with required permission
Terraform installed
Jenkins setup with necessary plugins
Kubernetes cluster (EKS) configured
Argo CD and Helm installed

# Steps to Automate Deployment
Deployment Steps
Clone the repository:
Initialize and apply Terraform scripts to provision AWS resources:
terraform init
Configure Jenkins pipeline to build and push the application Docker image to ECR.
Deploy the application using Helm charts:
helm install my-app ./helm-chart
Set up Argo CD for continuous deployment.
Monitor the application using Prometheus, Grafana, or AWS CloudWatch.

#### Conclusion
This project automates the entire Kubernetes deployment process, ensuring scalability, reliability, and efficiency in application delivery. By integrating Terraform, Jenkins, Helm, Argo CD, and monitoring tools, it provides a robust DevOps pipeline for modern cloud applications.
